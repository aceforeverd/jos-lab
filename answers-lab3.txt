1. What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for each exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to the same handler, what feature that exists in the current implementation could not be provided?)

2. Did you have to do anything to make the user/softint program behave correctly? The grade script expects it to produce a general protection fault (trap 13), but softint's code says int $14. Why should this produce interrupt vector 13? What happens if the kernel actually allows softint's int $14 instruction to invoke the kernel's page fault handler (which is interrupt vector 14)?
