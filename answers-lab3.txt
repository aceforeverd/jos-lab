1. What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for each exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to the same handler, what feature that exists in the current implementation could not be provided?)
 each descriptor of the idt can be slightly different. E.g. the permission(dpl) of each descriptor is not the same. 
 More customization.
 Avoid mess up with each other.

2. Did you have to do anything to make the user/softint program behave correctly? The grade script expects it to produce a general protection fault (trap 13), but softint's code says int $14. Why should this produce interrupt vector 13? What happens if the kernel actually allows softint's int $14 instruction to invoke the kernel's page fault handler (which is interrupt vector 14)?
  Nop. The descriptor privilege level of trap 14 is set to 0, which means it can only handled in kernel mode, user do not have the permission and a protect fault is produced
